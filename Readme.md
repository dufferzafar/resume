# Resume

My LaTeX based resume. Uses the [moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) template with some slight modifications.

## Todos

* Figure out how to have two separate versions
    * for Desktop & for Print.
    * Print version won't have any URLs etc.

* Use `pandoc` to generate *decent* markdown.

* Color / B & W Modes

* Figure out how to track the edited moderncv theme with git

**Issues**

* Add some space between Project title and it's description.

* Some part is italics, and then suddenly the next part isn't. Looks Odd, IMO.

* Display links to code.
