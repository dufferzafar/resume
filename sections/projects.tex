        Have written various scripts that perform tasks like sorting downloads, uploading screenshots to a webservice, creating automatic music playlists, help me decide what movie to watch, backing up data, creating a zero-byte harddisk mirror, importing data from iTunes to MusicBrainz, etc.
        On Windows, I have advanced knowledge of an automation language called AutoHotkey, but for the stuff that I need to use on *nix platforms as well, I use Python.
