        Added new features to a music tagging tool called \href{http://picard.musicbrainz.org/}{Picard} and created a new website for it.
        \newline
        I used Python (with Flask) for the backend and Bootstrap to ease the pain of frontend development.
        To make GUI based additions to the tool, I had to understand the workings of the Qt framework and its PyQt bindings.
