        Project was to make improvements to a music review website called CritiqueBrainz.
        \linebreak
        I added support for maintaining history of reviews, created an admin interface,
        improved code coverage, allowed other entities (like musical events) to be reviewed among other things.

        Project was to add features to a music tagging tool and create a new website for it.
        \linebreak
        I used Python (with Flask) for the backend and Bootstrap to ease the pain of frontend development.
        To make GUI based additions to the tool, I had to understand the workings of the Qt framework and its PyQt bindings.
